Download this simple Python script. When you run it from the command line, it takes one parameter. So $> python specialMath.py 7 will produce 79. Also, $> python specialMath.py 17 will produce 10926. This question has two parts: first, convert it to Scala; second, have the script calculate $> specialMath 90.

SpecialMath.scala      is the implementation of the answer.
TC_SpecialMath.scala   is the unit test class that proves that SpecialMath.scala  performs returns the desired output specified in the quiz question.
