The Main window in this javascript demo is "index.html"

In this first checkin the technical audience looking at these files will be confused by the blank screen that is displayed in the browser when they try openning index.html. I'm checking in the code as is now because I want the audience to have the ability to browse the important parts of my code asap. Those important files written entirely by me are:

1) configureClinicalDecisionSupportWindowPlugin.js
2) configureClinicalDecisionSupportWindow.js

** coming soon **
I will use the java code and corresponding unit test to generate some initial JSON data so that the screen and all its javascript will be operational
