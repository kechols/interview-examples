This Github repository contains example code that I, Kevin Echols wrote. The primary purpose of it is to reviewed by a technical audience to evaluate me for potential employment opportunities.

The lack of comments in the C# code is because there are test for almost all the code that have very descriptive names for what the code does (i.e. NullDateShouldReturnEmptyString).

The few comments that are present are for algorithms, code / test which does not pass because the code requires a resource like a database required for the code /test to successfully execute.

** Note I developed the c# solutions with Visual Studio 2015

** In addition to the code examples that I have checked into this github repository. I can also checkin in any other non proprietary code that I have. So those of you that have my contact information from my resume - if you have any questions or would like to see examples of something in particular please email or text me. If I have never done what you are interested in I will let you know right away. **
