This Github repository contains example code that I, Kevin Echols wrote. The primary purpose of it is to reviewed by a technical audience to evaluate me for potential employment opportunities.

The lack of comments in the C# code is because there are test for almost all the code that have very descriptive names for what the code does (i.e. NullDateShouldReturnEmptyString).

The few comments that are present are for algorithms, code / test which does not pass because the code requires a resource like a database required for the code /test to successfully execute.

** Note I developed the c# solutions with Visual Studio 2015
